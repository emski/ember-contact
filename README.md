ember-contact
=============

Please reimplement [this angular.js application](http://contactpath.liberlabs.com) using ember.js.  Review the templates in `index.html` (you're welcome to change them in any way) and add your implementation to `js/app.js`.

So that you don't spend more than four hours on this exercise, please note the following:

1. Validation rules may be much simpler
2. Contacts do not need to be stored in localStorage -- we can start with a fresh contact list every page load
3. The loading animation has been removed


Guys, 
Please check out my implementation. Seems to be working the same way as the anlular one does.

p.s. 
- I did a shortcut by not implementing recalculation of contact categories dynamically, 
but put a hardcoded alphabet array instead. That could be done by adding a dynamic property watcher if necessary.
- Put few initial contacts to the DS as well.

Thank you.
